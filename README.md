# Group 6 ISDS2024
Welcome to the repository for Group 6 of the Social Data Science course attended in the summer of 2024 at the University of Copenhagen.

Our repository contains of 3 different notebooks to simplify navigation in our code.

## Jupyter Notebooks:
1. `1_Weather_data_api.ipynb` is our first notebook, which focuses on gathering weather data from DMI. Data from this Notebook is saved in the CSV file **weather_data_final**.

2. `2_Web_scrapping.ipynb` is our second notebook, which focuses on web scrapping TripAdvisor for customer ratings. Data from this Notebook is saved in the CSV file **ratings_final**.

3. `3_OLS_and_LASSO.ipynb` is our third and final notebook, which implements a Machine Learning framework on our collected data. Data applied in this Notebook is saved in the CSV file **data_final**.

Please note that when attempting to scrape TripAdvisor, different advertisements may be encountered. We have stored our results, which were scraped on 23-08-2024. When trying to reproduce these results from scratch, you might encounter different ads, potentially leading to variations in the data. To replicate our results accurately, we recommend using our pre-saved data.
