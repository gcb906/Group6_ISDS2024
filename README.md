# Group 6 ISDS2024
Welcome to the repository for Group 6 from the Social Data Science course held in the summer of 2024 at the University of Copenhagen.

This repository contains three distinct Jupyter notebooks to facilitate easy navigation through our code.

## Jupyter Notebooks:
1. `1_Weather_data_api.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on gathering weather data from DMI. The resulting data is saved in the CSV file **weather_data_final**.

2. `2_Web_scrapping.ipynb`: This notebook centers on web scraping TripAdvisor for customer ratings. The collected data is saved in the CSV file **ratings_final**.

3. `3_Descriptive_statistics.ipynb`: This notebook briefly showcases and present all data collected.

3. `4_OLS_and_LASSO.ipynb`: This final notebook applies a Machine Learning framework (OLS and LASSO) to our collected data. The data used in this notebook is saved in the CSV file **data_final**.

Please note that when attempting to scrape TripAdvisor, different advertisements may be encountered. We have stored our results, which were scraped on 23-08-2024. When trying to reproduce these results from scratch, you might encounter different ads, potentially leading to variations in the data. Additionally, as the website is regularly updated, the list of restaurants may change, with some being added, removed, or updated. To replicate our results accurately, we recommend using our pre-saved data.
